# Weather App - John Zigterman

## Description

- I created an app that allows you to look up weather by searching for a city name.
- The app uses the openweather API and produces current weather conditions.
- The app also gives the user a five day forecast beyond the current day for the selected city.
- The most recently searched city is saved as a button for easy use in the future.

## Installation

This is a web based app and can be viewed using any web browser.

## Usage

A user who wishes to know the weather forecast in a particular city for the next five days can use this app to retrieve that data in a simple manner.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
